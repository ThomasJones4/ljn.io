SDCI+ is an esoteric file format used by a system called LENNON. There isn't much information about it publically available. The video below gives a very high level introduction to SDCI+ and it's function in a Ticket Issuing System.

Slides are available on [Google Drive](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/17Fnaq6QxPSpAl0xIiNpai6qwlam1T02QwCJN70goX3E/edit?usp=sharing)

As usual I caveat this with - it is my current understanding of the system and not to be taken as 100% gospel.
