The code for the demo is available on [GitHub](https://www.github.com/linusnorton/continuous-deployment-demo). Each step of the process in a branch step1 to step7 and the final result is in the master branch. The build is available on [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/linusnorton/continuous-deployment-demo) but the deployment key has been disabled as it is visible during the demo.
